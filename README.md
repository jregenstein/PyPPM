# PyPPM
A python module for generating PPM signals using the sound card, for emulating buddy box signals. Originally for [this](https://github.com/SeanCCarter/myo-quadcopter-controller) project.

TODO:
Get sample rate from sound card
Make stop function work
Allow client code defined input range
Set up for pip
Think this over when I'm less tired.
